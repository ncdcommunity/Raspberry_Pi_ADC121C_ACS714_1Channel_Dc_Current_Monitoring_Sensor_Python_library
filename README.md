# ADC121C_ACS714

The ACS714-5 is a very popular Hall Effect current sensor from Allegro MicroSystems with 5-Amps current monitoring capability and high-speed 5 Î¼S response time.  Married to the ADC121C021 (Texas Instruments), one of our favorite analog-to-digital Converters, this mini module can be used for monitoring DC current at up to 188.9k Samples per Second with 12-bit resolution. 
This Device is available from www.ncd.io
